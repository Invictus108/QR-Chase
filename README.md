# QR Chase

**QR Chase** is an exciting, touch-free game of tag that combines physical activity with the use of smartphone technology. Players wear printed QR codes on their backs and use their smartphones to scan the QR codes of other players in an attempt to "tag" them. The game provides a modern, tech-driven twist on the classic game of tag, making it accessible and engaging for all ages.

## How It Works

1. **QR Code Setup**: Each player attaches a unique printed QR code to their back. These QR codes act as the player's identifier in the game.

2. **Scanning**: Using a smartphone, players can scan the QR codes of other players to "tag" them. A successful scan registers a tag in the game system, and the tagged player's status is updated based on the game mode.

3. **Gameplay**: The game continues as players attempt to avoid getting tagged by keeping their QR codes away from other players while simultaneously trying to scan others' QR codes. The game is touch-free and requires quick reflexes, strategy, and speed.

## Game Modes

QR Chase offers several unique game modes to keep the gameplay fresh and challenging:

1. **Normal Mode**:
   - This is the default game mode where players attempt to tag others as many times as possible within a set time limit. The player with the most tags at the end of the game is the winner.

2. **Lives Mode**:
   - Each player is given a limited number of lives (e.g., 3 lives). Every time a player is tagged, they lose a life. The last player standing, after all others have lost their lives, wins the game.

3. **Spectator Mode**:
   - Players who are tagged out in Lives Mode can join as spectators and follow the game, scanning QR codes but not participating in tagging. Spectators can also have special roles, like sending hints or sabotages to active players.

## Key Features

- **Touch-Free Interaction**: The game is completely touch-free, making it a hygienic and safe option for large gatherings or events.
  
- **Physical Activity**: Encourages players to stay active by running, dodging, and scanning QR codes. It blends physical play with technology, creating an engaging experience for players of all ages.

- **Smartphone Integration**: Players can use their smartphones to scan other players' QR codes, allowing for an easy-to-play experience without the need for additional devices.

- **Customizable Rules**: Players can easily adjust the game modes, set time limits, or create their own house rules to make the game more exciting and tailored to their preferences.

## How to Play

1. **Preparation**: 
   - Print out unique QR codes for each player and attach them to their backs using safety pins or adhesive.
   - Set up a designated play area where the game will take place.

2. **Game Setup**:
   - Players gather with their smartphones ready to scan. The host selects the game mode (Normal, Lives, Team, etc.), and the game begins.
   
3. **Gameplay**:
   - Players move around the play area, trying to scan the QR codes of others while protecting their own QR code.
   - Depending on the game mode, the rules for tagging or elimination will vary, adding to the challenge and excitement.
   
4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game ends based on the selected mode's winning condition (e.g., highest number of tags, last player standing). Winners are determined based on the game mode's objectives.

## Equipment Required

- **Smartphones**: Each player needs a smartphone with a camera and QR code scanning capability. Most smartphones today come equipped with built-in QR code scanning via the camera app or through third-party QR code scanner apps.
  
- **Printed QR Codes**: Each player must have a printed QR code attached to their back. You can generate QR codes using any free online QR code generator.

## Benefits of QR Chase

- **Inclusive Fun**: Suitable for players of all ages and skill levels, making it perfect for family gatherings, parties, school events, or corporate team-building activities.
  
- **Safe Gameplay**: The touch-free nature of the game allows for safe play, especially in environments where physical contact is restricted or discouraged.

- **Easy Setup**: The game is easy to set up with minimal equipment—just smartphones and printed QR codes—allowing players to jump into the action quickly.

## Future Improvements

- **Advanced QR Code Tracking**: Integrate advanced tracking to prevent cheating by players covering their QR codes or scanning too quickly.
  
- **Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**: Explore the potential of AR to make the scanning process more immersive, possibly by adding visual effects or challenges to QR codes.
  
- **Mobile App Development**: Create a dedicated mobile app that allows for automatic QR code generation, score tracking, and dynamic game modes.
